    <title>Fall Burpee Plan</title>

        <h1 class="heading">Burpees</h1>
        <p>
            This fall, I will be doing burpees for cardio and some of my strength work. 
            Last year I went for runs and made some decent progress, then I lifted for a while and almost got back up to where I was before work caused me to stop lifting. 
            So, this year, I will try to work into doing a stupid amount of burpees. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The plan will take things pretty slow;
            while I can do probably 20-30 burpees in a row, I will start off with less than 5. 
            In fact, I will start off with singles for a few days, with doubles, triples, etc. interspersed. 
            This will allow me to focus on form until the movement becomes comfortable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Goal: 100 continuous burpees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is what I am thinking&mdash;do the following most days:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Week</th><th>Reps</th><th>Sets</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td><td>1-5</td><td>5-10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td><td>2-5</td><td>5-10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td><td>3-5</td><td>5-10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td><td>4-5</td><td>5-10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5</td><td>5</td><td>10</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            Most likely, I will miss a lot of days, or progress much quicker, it will have to be adjusted. 
            Day 1 is 19 Oct 25. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I will be supplementing these with chinups when able. 
            I can do about 3 pretty strict ones at this point, but will stick to singles and doubles. 
            Shooting for 5 or 10 every other day.
