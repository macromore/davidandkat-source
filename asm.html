            Objective: Layout the basics of programming in x64 Assembly on Linux using NASM.

            Will be updated.

        <h2 class="heading">The basics</h2>
        <p>
            We'll start with the basics; an informal overview. 
            The main thing to keep in mind is that ASM is a low-level language. 
            This means that you are limited to what is baked on the chip. 
            Programs work by executing instructions sequentially, unless there is a jump instruction. 
            We will have to spend a lot of time with very basic I/O on the command line.
        </p>
        <p>
            I should mention now, I will be using Debian 13 (pretty much any GNU/Linux system will work). 
            The system calls are for GNU/Linux so they won't work on say iOS. 
            The assembler I will use is NASM, and I'll use GCC or LD for the linker. 
            The main reason to use GCC over LD is it will allow us to use standard c functions like printf.
