    My research interests have to do with non-linear analysis and computer assisted proof. For instance, I am interested in <em>invariant manifolds</em> of dynamical systems. My dissertation dealt with invariant manifolds of the <strong>area-preserving Henon map</strong> and the <strong>Standard map</strong>. As well as a computation scheme to compute <em>Siegel Disks</em> in simple quadratic maps.

    For now, I will start to add some math notes on more elementary stuff.
