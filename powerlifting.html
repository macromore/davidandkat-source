        Note that I am doing preacher curls to help bring up my bicep and strengthen the elbow locked position. 
        I find any other curl doesn't really help my overhead support or bench press in the same way. 
        Once I've adjusted to these lifts they will get cycled out.

        The Olympic lifting portions are done with some standard warm up: high, hang, etc. variations. 
        I do squat jerks here because the platform is relatively small. 
        The complexes are to keep me from trying to max them out every day.
