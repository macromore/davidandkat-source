# davidandkat-source

This is the repository to control my personal website, [davidandkat.net](https://www.davidandkat.net).
Over the coming months, I intend to apply what I learn from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) to this project in order to make it a decent experience.
So far, it is just plain HTML with a little CSS and some markdown that I converted to HTML as a test.

The plan is to slowly build out some actual content along the lines of math tutorials, and so on.
Just a place to put up my various interests.
